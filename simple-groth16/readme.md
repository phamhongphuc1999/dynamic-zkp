### Simple zk-SNARK groth16

I demo a very simple zk-SNARK groth16 following the excellent [post](https://medium.com/coinmonks/under-the-hood-of-zksnark-groth16-protocol-2843b0d1558b). In my opinion, this post is good in code demo (using only python library so easy to implement) and explanation. However, if i want to understand more about zk-SNARK in general and groth16 in practice, i recommend some other interesting post

-   [The KZG/Kate Polynomial Commitment Scheme](https://risencrypto.github.io/Kate/): This post introduces KZG Polynomial Commitment Scheme.
-   [Groth16 zkSNARK](https://risencrypto.github.io/Groth16/): This post introduces Groth16. In my opinion, some demo codes are difficult to understand, but the mathematical explanation is very good (In my opinion, i think the explanation in this post is more detail in that [post](https://medium.com/coinmonks/under-the-hood-of-zksnark-groth16-protocol-2843b0d1558b)).

### Usage

I use python virtual environment, to activate it, just run

```shell
source ./venv/bin/activate
```
